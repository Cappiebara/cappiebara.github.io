                    <h2>About</h2>

                    <p>I‚Äôm a software engineer passionate about creating elegant, human-oriented software that combines thoughtful design and robust engineering. My perspective on software is that is is a cross between an art and a science, and my favorite work is when I can explore this junction while ensuring performance and helpfulness.</p>

                    <p>Currently, I work as the Accessibility Team Lead at the Center for Instructional Design and Technology at Southeastern Oklahoma State University. I assist with technical support, as well as creating and maintaining software and processes to ensure quality and accessibility in courses while optimizing efficiency through automation.</p>

                    <p>Outside of work, I am a computer science student (graduating December 2025) who also codes as a hobby. Some of my personal projects can be found at the bottom of this website under the Projects title. I have long held an interest in programming runtime modifications for Apple platforms to customize the user experience and add helpful features.</p>
